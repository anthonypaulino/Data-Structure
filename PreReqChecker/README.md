Summary: Program that implements directed graphs and adjacency list in Java to help navigate through school 
courses. With input data the program creates a list with courses linked to their perquisites. You can use the program to validate 
if a certain course is a prerequisite for another. It also presents the eligible courses with data of courses taken; the program can 
produce a schedule plan to take a target course in the fewest possible number of semesters.
